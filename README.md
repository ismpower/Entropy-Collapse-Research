# 🌀 Entropy Collapse Research Repository

Welcome to the official repository for the **Entropy Collapse Hypothesis**, a unifying theoretical model that explores the deep connection between entropy, black holes, and fundamental particle formation. This project is structured to support rigorous peer review, simulation reproducibility, and theory development.

---

## 🔬 Project Summary

The Entropy Collapse Hypothesis proposes that:

- Entropy is not a secondary property of matter/energy, but the **fundamental organizing principle** of spacetime.
- **Black hole cores** act as entangled low-entropy stabilizers that project particle identity into our universe.
- **Temperature and time** are emergent phenomena, not fundamental dimensions.
- At the critical entropy threshold (Bruno Constant), a **3D system collapses to a 2D field**, enabling a surface-projected reassembly of fundamental particles.

This repository captures every simulation, script, and visual asset produced in pursuit of this hypothesis.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Bruno Constant**: The entropy collapse threshold marking the transition from volumetric to surface-based systems.
- **Collapse Coherence Map**: Tracks entropic convergence points across simulations.
- **Entropy Reassembly Function**: Model for how fundamental particles emerge from entropy-based structure.
- **Dimensional Flattening**: Describes how entropy drives geometry from 3D toward 2D at low energy states.

## 🧭 Author Notes

This repository is part of a multi-phase thought experiment that began in February 2025 and continues to evolve daily. It honors the memory of Bruno, the constant companion whose name now represents the threshold of dimensional entropy collapse.

Let’s reshape how we understand entropy, one collapse at a time.
